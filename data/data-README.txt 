data-README.txt

This is a placeholder file in the GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/proctor-ucsf/CHAT-primary

The first script in the analysis (0-CHAT-Download-Public-Data.R) will download publicly available data from the Open Science Framework and will store it here (in data).  

The original datasets are located on OSF: https://osf.io/b3xwd/

From these datasets, the scripts in the repository will then run all of the analyses for the CHAT trial primary outcome paper.
